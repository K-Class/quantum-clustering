# quantum-clustering

This repository contains materials for a quantum clustering project that explores using quantum computing for data clustering tasks.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how quantum computing techniques can be applied to clustering problems, comparing classical k-means with quantum-based implementations.

## Getting Started

The main notebook [quantum_clustering.ipynb](quantum_clustering.ipynb) contains the full implementation and explanations of:

1. Classical k-means clustering and its limitations
2. Quantum data encoding strategies
3. Quantum k-means algorithm implementation
4. Results analysis and visualization

The notebook also includes three interactive MCQ quizzes to test your understanding of:
- Classical k-means concepts
- Quantum encoding methods
- Quantum k-means algorithms

## Requirements

The project requires Python with libraries including qiskit, matplotlib, numpy, and scikit-learn.
